# AirCraftEDA-and-ML-Modelling

The data used in this project was given by Purwadhika.
The data was scrapped from 2 different sources so the problem in this notebook was wrangling those data to the correct types and format.

This notebook is about Exploratory Data Analysis dan Maching Learning modelling of aircraft prices.

The ipynb file size was too big so i uploaded it in form of zip.
